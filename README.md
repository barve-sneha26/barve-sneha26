# Hi there 👋 I'm Sneha Barve, a Data Enthusiast and Recent Analytics Graduate 🎓🔍

I'm a passionate data professional with a strong foundation in analytics, machine learning, and data engineering. With a Master’s degree in Analytics from Northeastern University, I’m driven by the challenge of transforming complex datasets into clear, actionable insights that guide business decisions.

My journey in data has been shaped by hands-on experience across diverse projects and industries, ranging from automating data processes to building predictive models and creating dynamic visualizations. I've had the opportunity to work on enhancing OCR systems, integrating analytics into robotics, and developing customer segmentation strategies, all while collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver impactful solutions.

### Here are some areas I focus on:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uncovering patterns and trends to tell compelling data stories.
- **Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling:** Building models that drive data-driven decisions.
- **Data Engineering:** Designing robust pipelines and optimizing data flows.
- **Data Visualization:** Crafting intuitive dashboards that communicate insights effectively.

Feel free to explore my repositories where I showcase my work in Python, R, SQL, and cloud technologies. I’m always open to connecting and collaborating on projects that push the boundaries of data science and analytics.
