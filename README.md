### Hi there 👋 
#### I'm Sneha Barve, Data & Analytics Engineer focused on building scalable data platforms and intelligent reporting systems across modern cloud ecosystems.

I design and implement end-to-end data solutions — from ingestion and transformation to modeling, validation, and business-facing analytics layers.

Over the past few years, I’ve worked on:

• Designing Medallion (Bronze → Silver → Gold) data pipelines on Azure Databricks & Delta Lake  
• Building ingestion pipelines from Blob Storage, APIs, and relational databases into structured warehouse models  
• Developing reusable PySpark transformation modules to handle schema drift, deduplication, and data standardization  
• Migrating and validating 2M+ records across warehouse systems with reconciliation frameworks  
• Creating automated reporting layers and stakeholder-ready dashboards used for revenue tracking, performance monitoring, and operational decision-making  
• Implementing backend semantic search capabilities using vector databases to enable intelligent data retrieval workflows  

I work closely with stakeholders in Agile environments, translating business requirements into reliable, production-grade data systems.

Tech Stack:
Python | SQL | PySpark | Databricks | Snowflake | dbt| BigQuery | Airflow | Azure | AWS | Power BI | Vector Databases

Currently exploring applied AI systems and agentic workflows built on open-source frameworks.


Feel free to explore my repositories where I showcase my work in Python, R, SQL, BI and cloud technologies. I’m always open to connecting and collaborating on projects that push the boundaries of data science and analytics.
